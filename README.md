## Technology Stack:

HealthWell is built with a modern and robust technology stack, ensuring a responsive, scalable, and secure application:

### Frontend:

*   **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React's efficiency and flexibility enable a smooth user experience.
*   **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development environment with instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build processes.
*   **ESLint:** A powerful static code analysis tool that helps maintain code quality, consistency, and identify potential issues in the JavaScript and JSX codebase.

### Backend:

*   **Node.js:** A high-performance JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling efficient and scalable server-side development.
*   **Express.js:** A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building RESTful APIs.
*   **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL document database known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance, ideal for handling diverse health data.
*   **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
*   **bcryptjs:** A library used for securely hashing passwords, ensuring that sensitive user credentials are never stored in plain text.
*   **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** Implemented for secure and stateless user authentication, allowing for efficient and reliable API authorization.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Middleware configured to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend, handling cross-origin requests.
*   **dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, keeping sensitive configurations out of the codebase.
*   **nodemon:** A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, significantly enhancing the development workflow.

## Getting Started:
